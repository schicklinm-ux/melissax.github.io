  <h3>Receptionist and cashier at the Centre Nautique Pierre de Coubertin</h3>
  <h3> (Saint-Louis, 68)</h3>
  <p>During the last summers, I worked as cashier at the Centre Nautique Pierre de Coubertin in Saint-Louis (Alsace, France), near Basel. I had to answer the customers' questions, give them tickets in order to enter the pool.</p>
  <p>This summerwork was very beneficial for me. It was my first step in the working world. As I began, I was very shy and afraid of people. But the more time I spent there, the more I became confident and was not shy anymore. I became un pilier and the customers were adoring me.</p>
  <p>I always had a smile and I always did the best to satisfy the customers.</p>
