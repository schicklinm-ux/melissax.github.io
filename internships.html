  <h1>Internships</h1>
  <h3>M1 Immunology and Inflammation : Formation of organoids in the non-small-cell lung cancer</h3>
  <p>I witnessed the organoid formation protocol and the delivery of the treatment.</p>
  <p>Then, I was tasked with observing the organoids under a microscope after several days to see the effect of the treatment on their size and morphology.</p>
  <p>Finally, the organoids were frozen and I cut them up to perform tissue marking.</p>
  <p>This was mainly an observational internship.</p>

  <h3>M2 Immunology and Inflammation - Humanisation of the yeast for the study of centronuclear myopathy</h3>
  <p>I had to find culture conditions under which ymr1∆ does not grow,
ymr1∆ + hMTM1 grows, and ymr1 + hMTM1-C375S does not grow. The first step will
be used to verify whether the deletion of YMR1 is lethal in the SEY6210 genetic background. The second step will allow the plasmid expressing YMR1 to be replaced by a plasmid
    expressing MTM1 or the MTM1-C375S mutation.</p>
  <p>First, I extracted genomic DNA from yeast in order to amplify it using the Phire PCR kit. The DNA was then amplified by PCR. To do this, I followed a pre-established protocol and a pre-defined programme on the machine.</p>
  <p>At the same time, I transformed the yeasts with a plasmid. I first cultured the yeasts, then transformed them with the plasmid of interest and deposited the mixture on culture plates. The transformation was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p>
  <p>Finally, I marked the yeast vacuoles because the mutation linked to the disease under study plays a role in the size and morphology of the vacuole.</p>
  <p>These techniques required meticulousness, precision, patience and, of course, a critical mind.</p>

  <h3>L3 Chemistry : Formulations for the fabrication of a self-gelling material</h3>
  <p>I prepared different formulations according to different characteristics and then compared them according to different parameters (appearance, microscopy, rheology) in order to find the formulation that would produce a self-gelling material. To do this, I first made a simple water-in-oil emulsion using a polymer. I then used this emulsion to prepare a multiple water-in-oil-in-water emulsion in the presence of a surfactant.</p>
  <p>For each emulsion, I varied the proportions of the aqueous and oily phases. The addition of NaCl allowed me to change the texture and viscosity of the formulation. Subsequently, the addition of glucose allowed me to adjust the osmotic balance.</p>
  <p>Once I had prepared my different emulsions, I analysed their viscosity using a rheometer. I also carried out microscopic analyses.</p>
  <p>During this internship, my tutor gave me instructions and then left me to work independently. I demonstrated a high degree of rigour and organisation.</p>

  <h3>M1 Chemistry, Biology and Drug Design: Synthesis of irreversible inhibitors of CAZymes</h3>
  <p>In the synthesis of inhibitors, I carried out various experiments:
- protection of alcohols, a three-step strategy
- gold(I)-catalysed alkynylation
- 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
- deprotection
- N-alkylation.</p>
  <p>During these experiments, I used the vacuum pump daily. I regularly evaporated solvents using a rotary evaporator. I monitored my reactions using thin-layer chromatography. I purified my products using silica columns. I then performed NMR analyses of my products.</p>
  <p>My tutor was regularly absent, so I was left to my own devices most of the time. This allowed me to develop my independence and organisational skills. What's more, I gained confidence by repeating the same experiences over and over again.</p>
