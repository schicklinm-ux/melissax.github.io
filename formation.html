  <h3>Bachelor in Life Sciences - Mention Chemistry and Biology</h3>
  <p>The first year gave me the basis in biology, chemistry and other disciplines like genetics and physics. Since the second year, I get more lectures in several fields of chemistry : organic and inorganic chemistry, NMR.</p>

  <h3>Master in Life Sciences - Mention Immunology and Inflammation</h3>
  <p>I did this Master par dépit because I was rejected from the Master I initially wanted to do (Chemistry, Biology and Médicament, named today as Chemistry, Biology and Drug Design). It was mentally difficult because I didn’t like this field of science, even if I did Immunology during my Bachelor. Moreover, I didn't have the level to get into a research Master.</p>

  <h3>Third year of the Chemistry’s Bachelor - Mention Chemistry</h3>
  <p>I choose to do the third year of the Chemistry Bachelor in order to improve my level in chemistry after two years without any lectures on it. It was very beneficial.</p>

  <h3>Master in Chemistry - Mention Chemistry, Biology and Drug Design (named Chemistry, Biology and Médicament a few years ago)</h3>
  <p>And finally here I am, where I wanted to be three years back. The first year is quite pleasent but the second is not. I have the impression we have no more lectures on chemistry or biology. Only the part about drugs seems correct. But unfortunately, teachers don’k know how to make their lecture interesting, so it’s quite disappointing.</p>
