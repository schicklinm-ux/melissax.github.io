  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I’m Mélissa and I’m 24. I grew up adoring going to school and enjoying discovering new things. I started my learning journey with the scientific cursus in the lycée. Even if I did not get very good grades, I enjoyed it and wanted to continue. I went to Strasbourg to obtain a Bachelor in chemistry and biology, to further go for a master's degree in chemistry, biology and drugs. But things didn’t go very well and I finally went to the Master in immunology and inflammation. I ended it at contrecoeur because it was really not made for me but at least, I tried. I finally decided to go in chemistry, first by doing the third year of the bachelor's degree, and then to go into the master I first wanted, chemistry, biology and drug design (also known as chemistry, biology and drug). And it works very well and I am fulfilled.</p>
  <p>When I finish my master’s degree, I want to go into the pharmaceutical industry, first in Stasbourg and then in Basel. I want to be in the lab, producing and discovering new things, and maybe improving the world, who knows?</p>
  <p>If I have the opportunity, I will enjoy going around the world, working on several topics in different laboratories.</p>
  <p>Alongside my studies, I enjoy sports, cooking and lectures. I practice several sports: boxing, climbing, running and weight lifting. It permits me to relâcher la pression and to vider ma tête. It also gave me some confidence, by depassing my limits and always doing more.</p>
  <p>I also enjoy cooking, first because I enjoy the preparation but also because I enjoy eating prepared things and meals that are tasty. I do it mainly for myself but also for the people I love: it’s the manner I share my love to other people.</p>
