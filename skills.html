  <h1>Skills</h1>
  <h3>Biology</h3>
  <h4>Agarose gel electrophoresis</h4>
  <p>Agarose gel was used during practical laboratory sessions and during my internship in the context of protein extraction and purification. It was mainly employed to analyze protein samples at different stages of the purification process, in order to monitor protein separation and assess sample quality. The use of agarose gel allowed the visualization of biomolecules after migration, helping to verify the presence of the target protein and to evaluate the effectiveness of the extraction and purification steps.</p>
  <h4>Bacterial transformation</h4>
  <p>During my M2 internship in immunology, I had to use bacterial DNA for a transformation with a plasmid and then the purification of those plasmids with a kit. The transformation of the bacteria permitted me to enrich the quantity of plasmids I had due to the rapid growth of the bacteria.</p>
  <h4>Dialysis</h4>
  <p>During my studies, I attended practical laboratory sessions in purification and analysis of proteins. We had to purify a protein of interest. Dialysis was used as a purification step to remove small molecules such as salts or buffer components, enabling buffer exchange and improving protein purity for downstream analyses.</p>
  <h4>Genomic DNA extraction</h4>
  <p>During my M2 internship in immunology, I had to extract genomic DNA for a further amplification. For that, I followed a strict protocol that was given to me.</p>
  <h4>PCR</h4>
  <p>During my M2 internship in immunology and during practical laboratory sessions in purification and analysis of proteins, I did PCR several times. I followed the strict protocol that was given to me and the program written on the apparatus in order to amplify the DNA I had.</p>
  <h4>Staining</h4>
  <p>I used staining two times. The first time was during my M1 internship in immunology. Once my organoids were cut and put onto the microscope slide, I stained them with eosin and hematoxylin: eosin stains the cytoplam in rose while hematoxylin stains the nucleus in blue / violet. The second time was during my M2 internship in immunology.</p>
  <h4>Using a cryostat</h4>
  <p>During my M1 internship in immunology, I worked with a cryostat. Once the organoids formed and treated, I retrieved and cut them into very thin slices using a cryostat. Then, I put them onto a microscope slide for further experimentations (staining and microscopical observations).</p>
  <h4>Using a microscop</h4>
  <p>During my internships and during practical laboratory sessions during my studies, I used microscop many times. It permits me to observe very tiny things in the cell, or the stainings I did.</p>
  <h4>Using a rheometer</h4>
  <p>During my internship in the bachelor of chemistry, I used a rheometer for the analysis of my formulations.</p>
  <h4>Western blot</h4>
  <p>Western blot was used during practical laboratory sessions in purification and analysis of proteins to detect and analyze specific proteins after extraction and purification. This technique allowed the separation of proteins by size, their transfer onto a membrane, and their specific detection using antibodies. Western blotting was useful to confirm the presence of the target protein, evaluate its expression level, and assess the effectiveness of the purification process.</p>
  <h4>Yeast transformation</h4>
  <p>During my M2 internship in immunology, I had to transform yeast with plasmids. First, I put my yeast cells in culture. Second, I took those cells and transformed them with the plasmid in a reaction media containing PEG and DNA. Finally, this mixture was put on a petri dish and left for many days in the incubator.</p>
  <h3>Chemistry</h3>
  <h4>Analysis of an IR spectrum</h4>
  <p>During my studies, I have encountered IR spectra. I have taken courses that have provided me with the necessary knowledge (vibration, elongation, wavenumber) to analyse these spectra. It gave me insights to determine the structure of a molecule.</p>
  <h4>Analysis of an NMR spectrum</h4>
  <p>During my studies, I have frequently encountered one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra of protons and carbon. I have taken courses that have provided me with the necessary knowledge (chemical shifts, coupling constants) to analyse these spectra. I am able to determine the structure of a molecule based on its molecular formula and various NMR spectra.</p>
  <h4>Analysis of an UV spectrum</h4>
  <p>During practical work in organic and inorganic chemistry, I have to analyse the product I made. Using UV spectra, it gave me insight about the product I had.</p>
  <h4>Chemdraw</h4>
  <p>For my report about the internship I did in chemistry, I had to draw the reactions I made. I used Chemdraw. It was the first time and I had to learn by myself. Now, I can use Chemdraw without any problem.</p>
  <h4>Column silica chromatography</h4>
  <p>During my M1 internship in chemistry, or during practical work in organic chemistry, I was often required to purify a product using a silica chromatography column. Depending on the expected quantity of product, it is necessary to determine the diameter of the column and the amount of silica to be used. It is also necessary to choose the right eluent(s) in the appropriate proportions.</p>
  <h4>Determining a diffusion coefficient</h4>
  <p>As part of practical work in physical chemistry, I was asked to determine the diffusion coefficient of ferrocene in acetonitrile and the kinematic viscosity of acetonitrile using cyclic and stationary voltammetry and the Randles-Ševčik and Lévich equations.</p>
  <h4>Determining the concentration of a solution</h4>
  <p>As part of practical work in physical chemistry, I was asked to determine the concentration of a solution containing Cu2+ ions using a specific electrode and potentiometry on the one hand, and a microelectrode and cyclic voltammetry on the other.</p>
  <h4>Determining the denaturation temperature of a protein</h4>
  <p>As part of my practical work in physical chemistry, I studied the electronic transitions of benzene gas and tryptophan in order to determine the denaturation temperature of human serum albumin. To do this, I used spectroscopic measurements of absorbance and fluorescence.
Establishing a synthesis protocol
Whether in practical work in organic and inorganic chemistry or during my M1 internship in chemistry, I had to establish the protocol for the synthesis to be carried out. Our teacher provided me with the subject, the starting and end products, and the intermediate products, and thanks to bibliographic research, I was able to establish the procedure to follow.</p>
  <h4>Gas chromatography</h4>
  <p>During practical work in organic chemistry, I was asked to work on a solution composed of a mixture of a brominated compound and a chlorinated compound. The aim was to determine the ratio between bromine and chlorine. This is possible using gas chromatography. First, I inserted my brominated compound and my chlorinated compound separately to see where they came out. Then I inserted the mixture, and thanks to my previous experience, I was able to determine the ratio of brominated and chlorinated compounds.</p>
  <h4>Mestrnova</h4>
  <p>For my internship in chemistry or during practical work in organic and inorganic chemistry, I had to analyse the RMN spectrum of compounds. I followed courses in which the teacher gave me tips on how to use this software. Now, I am able to use it by myself.</p>
  <h4>Recristallisation</h4>
  <p>During my internship in chemistry, I had to purify a product. I put my product in the minimum amount of solvent and I heat until ebullition. Then I let it cool down slowly and crystals were formed.</p>
  <h4>Rotatory evaporator</h4>
  <p>During practical work in organic and inorganic chemistry, or during my internship in chemistry, I had to purify my product. For that, I had to eliminate the solvent inside. I used a rotatory evaporator, an apparatus using a heat bath and high pressure in order to decrease the temperature of ebullition of the solution. The liquid part goes out and the product stay in the flask.</p>
  <h4>Schlenk line</h4>
  <p>As part of practical work in synthetic chemistry, I had to use the Schlenk line. The double ramp allows us to place our reaction or molecule in an inert atmosphere (argon) or under vacuum in order to purify it.</p>
  <h4>Spartan</h4>
  <p>During practical work in infochemistry, I used Spartant, a computationa chemistry software, to model molecules and predict their physicochemical properties. By calculating the energies and the electronic distributions, I learnt about the molecular geometry, the stability and the reactivity.</p>
  <h4>Thin-layer chromatography</h4>
  <p>During my M1 internship in chemistry, or during practical work in organic chemistry, I was often required to check the progress of a reaction using thin-layer chromatography. To do this, it is necessary to carefully choose the eluent used.</p>
  <h3>Personal</h3>
  <h4>Canva</h4>
  <p>To help my father with his enterprise or for my studies, I use Canva very often. It’s a great tool to create CVs, backgrounds, posters, …</p>
  <h4>Digital creation</h4>
  <p>I help my father with his enterprise. I’m in charge of creating Instagram and Facebook publications with several topics about his job. I’m also in charge of his enterprise website. I mainly use Canva, Pinterest and Wix.</p>
  <h4>Google</h4>
  <p>My computer has been a Chromebook for several years. Chromebook means Google interface: no word, no powerpoint and so on. After using it everyday for several years, I’m very comfortable with all Google tools.</p>
